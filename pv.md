## Persistent Volume (PV)
Persistent Volume (PV) in Kubernetes is like a storage space you can reserve for your applications running in containers. It's a way to ensure that your data is not lost even if your application crashes or moves to a different server.

Imagine you have a photo-sharing app running on Kubernetes, and users upload photos. You don't want to lose those photos if a server crashes or if you need to move the app to another server. This is where PVs come in.

**Here's a basic example:**

* **Setting up a PV:** You, as the administrator, set up a PV with a certain amount of storage. Let's say you have 100 GB of disk space on your server, and you decide to reserve 20 GB for storing user photos.

* **Claiming Storage:** When a user uploads a photo, your app creates a request, called a Persistent Volume Claim (PVC), asking for some of that reserved storage. The PVC might ask for 1 GB to store the user's photo.

* **Binding:** Kubernetes checks if there's an available PV that matches the size and other criteria of the PVC. If there is, it binds the PVC to that PV, essentially saying, "Okay, you can use this 1 GB of storage."

* **Using Storage:** Your app can now use this bound PV to store the user's photo. It doesn't need to worry about where the storage is physically located or what happens if the server crashes.

* **Data Persistence:** Even if the server goes down, the PV ensures that the user's photo is still available when the app starts up on a different server. The data remains persistent.
