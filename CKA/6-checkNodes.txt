Check to see how many nodes are ready (not including nodes tainted NoSchedule) and write the number to /opt/KUSC00401/kusc0041.txt

Ans:

  -> Check the nodes
      kubectl get nodes | grep -i ready

      root@master:~/cka# kubectl get nodes | grep -i ready
          master     Ready    control-plane   3d16h   v1.27.1
          worker-1   Ready    <none>          3d16h   v1.27.1
          worker-2   Ready    <none>          3d16h   v1.27.1
      
  -> Check not including nodes tainted NoSchedule
        kubectl describe node master | grep -i taints | grep -i noschedule

        root@master:~/cka# kubectl describe node master | grep -i taints | grep -i noschedule
            Taints:             node-role.kubernetes.io/control-plane:NoSchedule

  -> Check both nodes (worker-1 and worker-2)
        root@master:~/cka# kubectl describe node worker-1 | grep -i taints | grep -i noschedule
        root@master:~/cka# kubectl describe node worker-2 | grep -i taints | grep -i noschedule

  -> write the number to /opt/KUSC00401/kusc0041.txt (Note: create a file and enter the number 2 and save)
